#### Resource Spawner Overhaul
- You have to enable "Use vanilla biter generation" in Startup tab and disable "Use RSO biter generation" in Map tab

#### Space Exploration
- Supports one race per planet!
- Randomly selects a race when a new planet/surface is created
- Change race for the planet you are on from UI

#### Krastorio2
- New races do not support creep generation unless author patches the creep generation code or its remote API.
    - https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Krastorio2/discussion/605d800cf3bb48c41a98cd6b
- turn on "Peaceful mode" in Krastorio2 setting to bypass the biomass requirements.
- More realistic weapons option must have "Auto-aim for MRW" enabled to hit air units.

#### Rampant AI (limited)
- It works with default settings.  However, its AI code only work for "enemy" force.  It does not affect custom enemy forces.
- It is NOT compatible with its custom biters at the moment.  Enabling them may crash the game.  I have not tested this.

#### Armoured Biters & Explosive Biters & Cold Biters
- All biters, worms and spawners support leveling.
- They join default enemy force, erm_vanilla.
- The health setting stacks with this mod's multiplier.
- Biters do not heal, spawner and worm do.

#### New Game Plus
- When the game resets, attack meter also reset.
- When "reset evolution factor" is checked, level, tier and evolution points are preserved. Evolution factor and attack meter get reset.
- When "reset research" is checked, everything reset.
