#### Resource Spawner Overhaul

- Change race for the planet you are on from UI

#### Krastorio2 (Requires 1.2+, in beta atm)
* New races support creep generation
* Custom bullets can hit air

#### Industrial Revolution
- Custom bullets can hit air

#### Armoured Biters & Explosive Biters & Cold Biters
- All biters, worms and spawners support leveling.
- They join default enemy force, erm_vanilla.
- The biter mods' multiplier stacks with ERM's multiplier. I suggest leave them alone and adjust the multiplier in ERM.

#### Rampant AI (limited)
- It works with default settings.  However, its AI code only work for "enemy" force.  It does not affect custom enemy forces.
- Rampant enemies override ERM enemies!  DO NOT enable them.

#### Other biter mods with tiers and level, like bobs enemy or natural evolution enemies.
- Not supported.  ERM override the biter spawners table.  They likely have unintended behaviours.

#### New Game Plus
- When the game resets, attack meter also reset.
- When "reset evolution factor" is checked, level, tier and evolution points are preserved. Evolution factor and attack meter get reset.
- When "reset research" is checked, everything reset.
