#### Compatilbility for 2.0

For 1.1, see https://github.com/heyqule/enemy_race_manager/blob/1.22.6/Mod-Compatibility.md

Overhaul mod compabitibility will be done when they become available.

#### Armoured Biters & Explosive Biters & Cold Biters & Toxic Biters

- All biters, worms and spawners supports quality spawning.
- They join default enemy force, enemy.
- The biter mods' multiplier stacks with ERM's multiplier. I suggest leave them alone and adjust the multiplier in ERM.
- ERM branded enemies have higher priority in autoplace control.  These spawners may not show up if there is conflict in the planet autoplace.

#### Other not mentioned enemy mods

- It may or may not work. Expect incompatibility.

#### AAI programmable vehicle

- It has a feature that prevent player/enemy build too close to each other.
- This affects proxy builder units which they build too close to your defenses, and you can't replace destroyed
  buildings.
- Try set "Deadzone construction denial range" to 5 tiles or something low. It defaults to 50 tiles.

#### Milestone

- Milestone for killing level 5/10/15/20 enemy command centers.
- Milestone for killing bosses

#### Super Weapon Attack Points / Counter Attack supported mods
- Ion Cannon [space-age]
