- Some protoss units from [Protoss - Akilea Tribe](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/erm_toss) (A rank)

**Tips on defense:**
- A LOT OF construction robots and repair kits. Automate repair network ASAP. Mix all turrets. Uranium bullets and flamethrowers are OP.
- Build multiple layers of turrets and walls in early game.  Don't bother repairing without automated bot repairs.  Replace the damage turret with new one and build wall after it destroyed.
- [Advanced Spaceship Repair](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/advanced_spaceship_repair) helps to repair entities in a batch on spaceship.  It's an optional dependency and it requires space-age.

# New Features
### Custom Enemy Evolution & Difficulty
Enemy evolution is based on Force's evolution factor and kills.  When enemy evolves, they pick a higher tier of the same units. The enemy evolve independently on each planet.  The more you kill, the quicker they evolve.

There are total of 5 tier for each enemy entity, from normal, great, exceptional, epic and legendary.  Which tier can you handle?

### New Unit Types
- Aerial units.
- Dropships, flying unit that spawn other units.
- Carriers, Unit that spawn other smaller units in a batch
- Builders, unit that builds spawner or turret on the spot.
- Invisible units, unit that can only be seen by certain turrets.
- Suicidal units, which kill themselves to cause massive damage.

### Custom Attack Groups & Attack Points
Custom attack groups are generated by attack points.  Everything you kill worth some attack points.  Once it hit a threshold, the enemy will send a wave of custom attack group to your base. They spawn on top of the base game's pollution based attacks.

There are various types of attack groups. Ground attack, Arial attack, dropships, stealth attacks. See in-game tip and tricks for details.

You should build air raid radar & siren to get early warning of aerial attacks.

### Custom Base Expansion
Enemy expansion are no longer build one structure at a time.  They build several spawners and turrets to have the best defense.

### Environmental Attacks
Some enemy may parasitize another unit to spawn them.  Other may be practising quantum teleportation with lightnings.

### Interplanetary attacks
Interplanetary raid starts once you kill any enemy structure in their home planet.  Any discovered planet with enemies are an candidate for interplanetary attack.

Enemy without home planet and "Enemy" force are not able to perform interplanetary attack.

### Free for all
This is currently only work for non Space Age game.  You'll have to select "Mixed mode" in Nauvis enemy and enable "Free for all" to active this feature.

When this is enabled, player entity health and enemy damage multiplied by 10x. The multipliers are to balance the time enemy units take to kill each other.

### Advanced Army Controls (Only for ERM - Terran, or other compatible mods)
- Dedicated unit assembly lines.
- Set up rally point for automated unit deployment.
- Unit teleportation between 2 areas, including between planets/surfaces.
- Unit population control

### New planets and space routes with tougher enemies.
Some enemy forces have home planet.  They are home to their Legendary forces.  Some of those planets have different resources and technologies to unlock.

### ERM Economy
Zerg, Protoss and Redarmy spawners drop loots.  Those loots are used for new recipes and new army units.  They can also convert to biter eggs.

When you are not playing with biter, you don't have to capture the "spawner" to get biter eggs.

Planet Aiur and Char use new minerals and geyser nodes.  They offer slightly different manufacture workflow.

### Boss discovery

Using PSI radar in enemy's home world will reveal their master mind.  Are you able to beat them for rewards?
