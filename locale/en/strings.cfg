[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
enemyracemanager-general-info=Thank you for installing this mod.  This mod aims provide a RTS experience with Factorio logistics.  It works best with other ERM branded mods.  It also enhances biters as well.\n\nEnemy mods:\nhttps://mods.factorio.com/mod/erm_zerg\nhttps://mods.factorio.com/mod/erm_protoss\nhttps://mods.factorio.com/mod/erm_redarmy(WIP for 2.0)\n\nPlayable units:\nhttps://mods.factorio.com/mod/erm_terran(WIP for 2.0)
enemyracemanager-enemy-difficulty=Enemy difficulty is determined by a custom tracker.  It combined enemy's evolution factor(30%) and accumulated [tip=enemyracemanager-attack-points](70%) to calculate the enemy progression on a planet.   The more you kill, they stronger they get.  There are 5 tiers of units. Each tier has significantly increased stats.  [shortcut=erm-detail-window-toggle] has evolution details for each enemy force.\n\nNormal: baseline stats. [entity=enemy--behemoth-biter--1] \nGreat:10% of the increased stats from legendary tier. [entity=enemy--behemoth-biter--2]  \nExceptional: 30% of the increased stats from legendary tier.  Reach maximum movement and attack speed. [entity=enemy--behemoth-biter--3] \nEpic:  60% of the increased stats from legendary tier. Reach max resistances. [entity=enemy--behemoth-biter--4] \nLegendary: legendary tier stats [entity=enemy--behemoth-biter--5] \n\nMaximum enemy difficulty and progression speed can be adjust in mod setting's map tab.  They can be adjust mid-game, but it will only affect new spawns.\n\nUnit's property multipliers can be adjusted in startup tab. These require game restart.\n\nSpawn rate under 100% progression of each difficulty:\nCasual - 70% Great, 30% Exceptional \nNormal - 30% Great, 60% Exceptional, 10% Epic \nAdvance - 70% Exceptional, 25% Epic, 5% Legendary \nHardcore - 50% Exceptional, 30% Epic, 20% Legendary \nFighter - 50% Epic, 50% Legendary \nCrusader - 25% Epic, 75% Legendary \nTheOne - 100% Legendary\n\nFactoriopeida only show one tier of unit, Normal by default.  You can change which tier to show in "Unit Tier in Factoriopedia" in startup setting.
enemyracemanager-new-enemy-types=The new enemy mods introduce many new unit types. \n- Flying units.\n- Dropships (unit that spawn other units)\n- Builders, unit that builds spawner on the spot.\n- Invisible units, unit that can only be seen by certain turrets.\n- Suicidal units, which kill themselves to cause massive damage.
enemyracemanager-attack-points=Attack points is a system that spawn [tip=enemyracemanager-custom_attack_groups].  Each enemy kill worth some attack points. When the attack points threshold is reached, the enemy will send out an army to attack its target. The default threshold is around 3000 points(~120 units) per attack group.\n\nThere are other activities that may increase attack points.\n- Launching rockets\n- Using super weapons.\n\nThere are many attack point settings in map settings.  Majority of the features are configurable.
enemyracemanager-custom_attack_groups=These attack groups are generated by [tip=enemyracemanager-attack-points].  They spawn on top of the base game's pollution based attacks.  There are various types of attack groups.\n\nGeneral groups include all units.  Early game uses tier 1 units, mid-game includes tier 2 units and late-game includes all units\nFlying groups only use aerial units.\nPrecision strike groups head straight to their target and ignoring any distraction.\nDropship groups are aerial units which spawn other units, they are always a precision strike group.\nFeatured groups - these are predefined signature groups for the enemy force. e.g a group with only zergling and ultralisk. It has ground and aerial variants.\nElite featured group - they are same as featured group but they have higher chance to roll higher tier units.\n\nTime based attacks always use a custom attack groups.\nYou can fine tune their settings in mod settings' map tab.
enemyracemanager-home-planets=Some enemy forces have their home planets.  They are home of their legendary forces. They also have their epic forces patrolling their space routes.  Are you ready to conquer them?
enemyracemanager-base-expansion=Enemies in ERM do not build spawner one at a time as they do in the base game.  Enemies use "Build a Town" logic by default, which build a "command center" spawner, several other spawners and turrets.  You can change it to other behaviours and its spawn formation in map settings.
enemyracemanager-free_for_all=Free for all works on mixed races modes.  You have to select "Mixed Race", "2 Way split" or "4 ways split" on Naivus and turn on the "Free for all" option.  When free for all is enabled, enemy damage and player entities' HP are increased to balance the fights.
enemyracemanager-environmental-attacks=Enemies are practicing different offensive techniques. They use the environment for their advantage.  Such as parasitize, quantum teleportation.
enemyracemanager-interplanetary-attacks=Currently OFFLINE.\n\nEnemies may launch interplanetary attack under certain conditions.  They may choose to expand into the new planet, instead of going for an offense.
enemyracemanager-advance-army-control=This feature is currently used by ERM Playable Terran.\n\nIt enables the following mechanics:\n-Unit control like you do in RTS\n-Building unit in dedicated military buildings.\n-Unit supply limit. Increase by combat robot research.\n-Rally point from military buildings\n-Command Center for unit teleportation. You can teleport between planet and space platform.
enemyracemanager-bosses=Currently OFFLINE.\n\nEnemeis in their home planet may have boss tier units and structures.  Conquer them and get rewards.
enemyracemanager-defense-tips=Play this mod like you do with your other regular RTS game.  If you fall behind on defense, defense tech and resource, your base will get steamrolled. \n\nEarly game:\n- Focus on setting up turrets and walls, overprovision them.\n- Focus on bullet research and other defense techs first.\n- Don't waste time with manual repairs. You should only replace the defense shortly after they can barely hold a wave to minimize base building downtime.\n- ALWAYS OVERPROVISION YOUR DEFENSE :)\n\nMid-late game:\n- Use all available turrets to cover all ranges.\n- Set up auto repair bots networks ASAP.\n- Set up defense supply trains for your outposts.\n- Expand until you are feel you are secure on resources.\n- Tank is your friend.\n- Friendly fire for explosive shells and explosive rockets are disabled by default. Utilize them without worries!\n- Upgrade quality wall and turrets. \n\nDefending precision strike group and dropships:\nAttack group usually target the following entity types. Build proper defense within a close proximity.\n- Outposts (Mining Drill, Furnace, Agricultural-tower)\n- Research facilities (Lab)\n- Space Facilities (Rocket silo, cargo landing pad)\n- Artillery.\n\nEnemy will immediately see your rocket silo and artillery as your build them.  Other entities will have to be discovered by their scouts./n/nVisiting new planets:/n- Bring enough defense items/n- Build solid defense around spawn area/n- Avoid being over offensive until your defense can hold back custom attack groups./n- When you are spawn camped, utilize uWuClear rapid delivery to clean out spawn area. 
enemyracemanager-other-faq=Mod Compatibilities:\nPlease see https://github.com/heyqule/enemy_race_manager/blob/main/Mod-Compatibility.md for up to date details.\n\nKnow Issue:\n- Peaceful mode does not work\n- "Enemy" force may pull unit from other planets to spawn. E.g Biters spawn on Gleba; Cold biter spawn on Vulcanus and etc. \n- Alien Biomes crashes Protoss mod because it disabled base rocks which Protoss' new planet uses.
